# Mate TODO List

- [ ] Motors
  - [ ] Test
  - [ ] Servos
  - [ ] Arming
- [ ] Sensors
  - [ ] Way to disable validating writes?
  - [ ] Sensor fusion
    - [ ] Try using a Kalman filter
    - [ ] Way to switch implementation at runtime
    - [ ] Use last sensor data as stating position
  - [-] Leak
  - [ ] Magnetometers
    - [ ] Calibration
  - [ ] Barometer
  - [ ] ADCs
  - [ ] Don't store raw frames in global store
  - [ ] Make sure sensors power down, etc on drop
  - [ ] Make sure sensors do a reset on init
  - [ ] Check data ready flags in read frame code
- [ ] Control
  - [ ] OpenCV control
  - [ ] Autonomous control
    - [ ] Pid stuff
  - [ ] New gamepad setup
  - [ ] Speeds larger than 1
- [ ] Debugging
  - [ ] Better logging
  - [ ] Better & more error notifs in ui
  - [ ] Tests
  - [ ] Make important settings editable in real time
- [ ] UI
  - [ ] Errors in uis should be handled better
  - [ ] Reduce usage of clone
  - [ ] Better video view
  - [ ] Fix orientation ui
  - [ ] Improve notifications
    - [ ] Animations
    - [ ] Color
    - [ ] Timer
  - [ ] Visualize our data
  - [ ] Use the LEDs on the navigator better
  - [ ] Make a README.md
  - [ ] Window to view and edit global store
    - [ ] Max motor speed, 
- [ ] Misc
  - [ ] Investigate high cpu usage on pi
  - [ ] Rename Ready to Disarmed and Armed to Ready
  - [ ] Implement remove for global store
    - [ ] Store timestamps is a separate map, this removes the need for 2 adapters and encodes knowledge of when an element was removed.
  - [ ] Some calls to log_error should be replaced with proper handling and or the opposite
  - [ ] Surface network system has too much responsibility
  - [-] Clear foreign store on disconnect
  - [-] Graceful shutdown
  - [ ] Image pi
  - [ ] Systemd service
  - [ ] Linters
  - [ ] Surface prints errors on shutdown
